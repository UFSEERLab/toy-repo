The goal of toy-repo is to provide a safe space to practice git and github workflows. You can use this repo to check that you can push and pull from your machine as well. 
Use this repo to test or practice pushing, pulling, creating branches, merging, etc. 

If you have any questions, you can write an issue. 

The goal of using git for version control is that it allows us to keep track of changes and how each user has made changes. No need to save multiple versions of scripts, you can create test branches and merge if your changes are good. 

[Github docs ](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) has a lot of resources to learn how to use a git workflow and communicate with github. If you are an R user, the [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR by Jenny Ryan](https://happygitwithr.com/) is one of the best things out there!
