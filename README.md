The goal of toy-repo is to provide a safe space to practice git and github workflows. You can use this repo to check that you can push and pull from your machine as well. 
Use this repo to test or practice pushing, pulling, creating branches, merging, etc. Even uploading files!

If you have any questions, you can write an [issue](https://github.com/UFSEERLab/toy-repo/issues). 

The goal of using git for version control is that it allows us to keep track of changes and how each user has made changes. No need to save multiple versions of scripts, you can create test branches and merge if your changes are good. 

[Github docs ](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) has a lot of resources to learn how to use a git workflow and communicate with github. If you are an R user, the [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR by Jenny Ryan](https://happygitwithr.com/) is one of the best things out there! This toy repo is an RProject and so changes are easily made using RStudio and the git pane within the RStudio IDE. 

## Get Started 

Below, you will find a few tasks that will help you get started with your GitHub journey. 

1. If you don't have a GitHub account, create one [here]( https://github.com/join). Once you have created your account, reach out to Javi or Jason to get added to the SEERLab org.
2. Check out this brief article to [start your journey](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git).
3. To understand the difference between your personal account and the SEERLab org account, follow  [this hello-world guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world) which will show you how to create a repo and run the basic workflow.

Once you've completed tasks 1-3, come back to this toy repo. **Did you know you can edit files directly from the GitHub website?** I wouldn't recommend this for running code, but if you need to annotate or include comments on scripts, edit READMEs, etc, the website is a good place to start. The task is to add on to our resource/practice script [i_was_here.R](https://github.com/UFSEERLab/toy-repo/blob/main/i_was_here.R). Let's do it!

1. As you saw in the [hello-world guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world), create a new branch for this toy-repo. You can call it [yourname]-branch.
2. Once on your branch, head to the script [i_was_here.R](https://github.com/UFSEERLab/toy-repo/blob/main/i_was_here.R) and edit it directly from the website.
3. Commit the changes to your branch.
4. Now that your branch has your changes, open a pull request ([step 4 in the guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world#step-4-open-a-pull-request)).
5. Review your changes and merge to the main branch. Once changes are merged, you can safely delete your branch.

YAY! you have created your first merge!

Now, let's practice commenting on this repo's [first issue](https://github.com/UFSEERLab/toy-repo/issues/1) by heading to that site and following the instructions within the issue thread.
